# entropy-markov-trajectory-

This code allows for computing the matrix of trajectory entropies associated with an irreducible finite state Markov chain.

Definitions and computations can be found

The example of the MC presented in this script is from the paper

  [2] The entropy of conditional Markov trajectories

To run the code with an example of a Markov chain given in [2]

  python trajectory_entropy.py
